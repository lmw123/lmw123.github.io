Dear Users,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that the DISCO server is currently experiencing technical issues. I’ve spent the past week trying to resolve the problem, but it appears to be a hardware issue with our data server, which is unfortunately beyond my ability to fix.

As a temporary solution, I’m in the process of migrating the data to my personal server to ensure continued access. This migration may take some time, and I sincerely appreciate your patience during this transition.

Additionally, I’d like to share that I will soon be starting a new job. As a result, I may not be able to continue maintaining the DISCO platform on its current URL. However, I will host a personal mirror and do my best to keep the data available. I’ll share the updated URL or mirror link as soon as it’s ready.

If you have any questions or need urgent access to data, please feel free to contact me at limengwei833@gmail.com.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Best regards,
Mengwei
